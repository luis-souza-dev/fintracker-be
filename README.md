# Fintracker BE

Small project to keep track of the household finances. I also plan to use this project to train skills related to DevOps adding a full CI/CD cycle to deploy the changes, unsure yet on which service.


## Initial Scope
At first i just want to do a basic flow of inserting my expenses, fetching this data and categorize it so I can visualize where we are spending the most

## Future Scope

 - [ ] Create dashboards to display our spending tendencies and add estimates for future months
 - [ ] Add a "Goals" section, where I'll be able to set my next goals and define how much I need to save monthly to achieve it
 - [ ] Create a investment tab to track data about cryptocoins/stocks (still in consideration)
 - [ ] Implement a event calendar and notes board so the residents of the household can keep track of each one schedules and upcoming events
 - [ ] Generate reports for tax purposes
